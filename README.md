# Bluetooth Service Enabler (Windows)
A small batch script that starts Windows Bluetooth services

Using Windows 11, sometimes my Bluetooth option completely dissappears. This is caused by Windows sometimes not starting the Bluetooth services on start-up.
You can manually start those services to get your Bluetooth back, but I wanted a 1-click option, so I made this batch script that starts those services.

If the services are already running, nothing is restarted or interrupted.

## How to use
1. Download the *EnableBluetoothServices.bat* batch file
2. Right-click *EnableBluetoothServices.bat*
3. Select **Run as Administrator**
5. Done

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Administrator permissions
